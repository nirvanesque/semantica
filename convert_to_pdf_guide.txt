HOW TO CONVERT HTML ATTACHMENTS TO PDF
========================================

Since automatic PDF conversion requires additional dependencies, here are 
the easiest methods to convert your HTML files to PDF:

METHOD 1: Using Web Browser (Recommended - Easiest)
----------------------------------------------------
1. Open each HTML file in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Press Ctrl+P (or File > Print)
3. In the print dialog, select "Save as PDF" or "Microsoft Print to PDF"
4. Click "Save" and save it in the attachments folder with the same name
   (e.g., technical_specification.html -> technical_specification.pdf)

Files to convert:
- technical_specification.html
- architecture_diagrams.html
- detailed_roadmap.html
- performance_benchmarks.html
- use_cases.html
- comparison_matrix.html
- community_engagement_plan.html

METHOD 2: Using Online Converter
---------------------------------
1. Go to https://www.ilovepdf.com/html-to-pdf
2. Upload each HTML file
3. Click "Convert to PDF"
4. Download and save in attachments folder

METHOD 3: Using Python (If you want to automate)
-------------------------------------------------
Install weasyprint:
  pip install weasyprint

Then run:
  python convert_to_pdf_simple.py

Note: weasyprint may require additional system dependencies on Windows.
If installation fails, use Method 1 (browser) instead.

METHOD 4: Using LibreOffice (If installed)
-------------------------------------------
1. Open LibreOffice Writer
2. File > Open > Select HTML file
3. File > Export as PDF
4. Save in attachments folder

VERIFICATION
------------
After conversion, you should have these PDF files in attachments/:
- technical_specification.pdf
- architecture_diagrams.pdf
- detailed_roadmap.pdf
- performance_benchmarks.pdf
- use_cases.pdf
- comparison_matrix.pdf
- community_engagement_plan.pdf

Plus the existing text file:
- budget_breakdown.txt (already in correct format)
