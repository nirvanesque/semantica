CONVERTING HTML FILES TO PDF FOR GRANT APPLICATION
====================================================

The grant application accepts: HTML, PDF, OpenDocument Format, and plain text.

You have 7 HTML files that should be converted to PDF for professional presentation.

QUICK METHOD (Recommended):
--------------------------
1. Open each HTML file in Chrome/Edge/Firefox
2. Press Ctrl+P (Print)
3. Select "Save as PDF" or "Microsoft Print to PDF"
4. Save in this folder (attachments/) with .pdf extension

Files to convert:
-----------------
1. technical_specification.html → technical_specification.pdf
2. architecture_diagrams.html → architecture_diagrams.pdf
3. detailed_roadmap.html → detailed_roadmap.pdf
4. performance_benchmarks.html → performance_benchmarks.pdf
5. use_cases.html → use_cases.pdf
6. comparison_matrix.html → comparison_matrix.pdf
7. community_engagement_plan.html → community_engagement_plan.pdf

Already in correct format:
--------------------------
- budget_breakdown.txt (plain text - no conversion needed)

After conversion, you'll have 7 PDFs + 1 TXT = 8 attachments ready!

ALTERNATIVE: Keep HTML files
----------------------------
If conversion is difficult, HTML files are also accepted by the grant application.
However, PDFs are more professional and easier for reviewers to read.
