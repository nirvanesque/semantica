OTHER FUNDING SOURCES
================================================================================

None. Semantica is a fully bootstrapped open-source project developed solo. 
Having quit my job as an AI Engineer to focus on this project, the grant is 
essential to sustain full-time development, expand the contributor base through 
mentorship and workshops, and bring Semantica to production maturity.

================================================================================
BUDGET ALLOCATION RATIONALE
================================================================================

1. Human Labor (64%): Core development work and contributor support to build
   sustainable open-source ecosystem.

2. Infrastructure & Tools (16%): Essential for testing, CI/CD, GPU compute,
   and multi-modal experiments.

3. Community & Travel (10%): Critical for growing the open-source community
   through workshops, conferences, and mentorship.

4. Research & Benchmarking (5%): Ensures quality and validates improvements
   through proper evaluation.

5. Contingency (5%): Standard practice for unforeseen challenges in technical
   projects.

6. Operational (3%): Necessary administrative and infrastructure costs.

This budget supports a sustainable 12-month development cycle, improved 
contributor experience, open workshops for the wider community, and a strong 
mentorship component to grow Semantica's open-source ecosystem.
