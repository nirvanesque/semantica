# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of Semantica with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.1   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.0.1 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. Report Security Issue

Create a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/Hawksight-AI/semantica/security/advisories/new) or contact us through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Hawksight-AI/semantica/issues) with "[SECURITY]" prefix.

Include the following information:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- **Affected component** (module, function, or file)
- **Steps to reproduce** (detailed description or proof-of-concept code)
- **Potential impact** (what could an attacker do?)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** (for follow-up questions)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

### 4. Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates on the status of the vulnerability
- Once fixed, we will credit you (if desired) in the security advisory
- We will coordinate public disclosure with you

## Security Update Process

1. **Assessment**: We assess the severity using CVSS scoring
2. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
3. **Release**: We release a security update
4. **Advisory**: We publish a security advisory on GitHub
5. **Communication**: We notify users through appropriate channels

## Severity Levels

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data breach or exposure
- **Response Time**: Immediate (within 24 hours)

### High
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data leakage
- Denial of service
- **Response Time**: Within 7 days

### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- **Response Time**: Within 30 days

### Low
- Minor information leakage
- Best practice violations
- **Response Time**: Next release cycle

## Known Security Considerations

### Dependencies

We regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. However, you should:

- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories for our dependencies
- Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to check for known vulnerabilities

### API Keys and Credentials

- **Never commit API keys or credentials** to the repository
- Use environment variables or secure configuration management
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use least-privilege access principles

### Data Handling

- Be cautious when processing untrusted data
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement rate limiting for public APIs

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Validate SSL/TLS certificates
- Be cautious with external API calls
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Dependency Security Policy

### Regular Updates

- We monitor security advisories for all dependencies
- We update dependencies regularly in our development branch
- Critical security updates are backported to supported versions

### Reporting Dependency Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability in one of our dependencies:

1. Check if it's already reported upstream
2. Report to us if it affects Semantica specifically
3. We will coordinate with upstream maintainers if needed

### Security Scanning

We use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities:

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates and security alerts
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Vulnerability tracking
- **Manual Reviews**: Regular security audits

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep Semantica Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Review Dependencies**: Regularly update your project dependencies
3. **Secure Configuration**: Use secure defaults and proper configuration
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for suspicious activity
5. **Report Issues**: Don't hesitate to report potential security issues

## Security Acknowledgments

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Security researchers who help us improve the security of Semantica will be:

- Credited in security advisories (if desired)
- Listed in our security acknowledgments
- Recognized for their contribution
