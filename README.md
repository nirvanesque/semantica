## AgentContext - Your Agent's Brain

The main interface that makes your agent intelligent. It handles memory, decisions, and knowledge organization automatically.

### Quick Start
```python
from semantica.context import AgentContext
from semantica.vector_store import VectorStore

# Create your intelligent agent
agent = AgentContext(vector_store=VectorStore(backend="inmemory", dimension=384))

# Your agent can now remember things
memory_id = agent.store("User asked about Python programming")
print(f"Agent remembered: {memory_id}")

# And find information when needed
results = agent.retrieve("Python tutorials")
print(f"Agent found {len(results)} relevant memories")
```

### Easy Decision Learning
```python
# Your agent learns from its decisions
decision_id = agent.record_decision(
    category="content_recommendation",
    scenario="User wants Python tutorial",
    reasoning="User mentioned being a beginner",
    outcome="recommended_basics",
    confidence=0.85
)

# Your agent can now find similar past decisions
similar_decisions = agent.find_precedents("Python tutorial", limit=3)
print(f"Agent found {len(similar_decisions)} similar past decisions")
```

### Getting Smarter Over Time
```python
# Enable all learning features
smart_agent = AgentContext(
    vector_store=vector_store,
    decision_tracking=True,    # Learn from decisions

print(f"Decision categories: {list(insights.get('categories', {}).keys())}")
```

## The Problem: The Semantic Gap

### Most AI systems fail in high-stakes domains because they operate on **text similarity**, not **meaning**.

### Understanding the Semantic Gap

The **semantic gap** is the fundamental disconnect between what AI systems can process (text patterns, vector similarities) and what high-stakes applications require (semantic understanding, meaning, context, and relationships).

**Traditional AI approaches:**
- Rely on statistical patterns and text similarity
- Cannot understand relationships between entities
- Cannot reason about domain-specific rules
- Cannot explain why decisions were made
- Cannot trace back to original sources with confidence

**High-stakes AI requires:**
- Semantic understanding of entities and their relationships
- Domain knowledge encoded as formal rules (ontologies)
- Explainable reasoning paths
- Source-level provenance
- Conflict detection and resolution

**Semantica bridges this gap** by providing a semantic intelligence layer that transforms unstructured data into validated, explainable, and auditable knowledge.

### What Organizations Have vs What They Need

| **Current State** | **Required for High-Stakes AI** |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| PDFs, DOCX, emails, logs | Formal domain rules (ontologies) |
| APIs, databases, streams | Structured and validated entities |
| Conflicting facts and duplicates | Explicit semantic relationships |
| Siloed systems with no lineage | **Explainable reasoning paths** |
| | **Source-level provenance** |
| | **Audit-ready compliance** |

### The Cost of Missing Semantics

- **Decisions cannot be explained** — No transparency in AI reasoning
- **Errors cannot be traced** — No way to debug or improve
- **Conflicts go undetected** — Contradictory information causes failures
- **Compliance becomes impossible** — No audit trails for regulations

**Trustworthy AI requires semantic accountability.**

## Semantica vs Traditional RAG

| Feature | Traditional RAG | Semantica |
|:--------|:----------------|:----------|
| **Reasoning** | Black-box answers | Explainable reasoning paths |
| **Provenance** | No provenance | W3C PROV-O compliant lineage tracking |
| **Search** | Vector similarity only | Semantic + graph reasoning |
| **Quality** | No conflict handling | Explicit contradiction detection |
| **Safety** | Unsafe for high-stakes | Designed for governed environments |
| **Compliance** | No audit trails | Complete audit trails with integrity verification |
