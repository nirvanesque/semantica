# 🗺️ SemantiCore Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision & Goals

**Mission**: Build the most comprehensive open-source semantic data transformation platform that bridges unstructured data and intelligent AI systems.

**Vision**: Enable anyone to transform any data format into intelligent, structured semantic knowledge graphs, embeddings, and ontologies for LLMs, Agents, RAG systems, and Knowledge Graphs.
